# useMatchMedia React Hook

This lightweight React hook simplifies the use of the `window.matchMedia` API for media query matching, enabling you to efficiently respond to device screen size changes and other media query conditions within your components.

## Installation

```bash
npm install abcdefuhooks
```
````

## Usage

Import the `useMatchMedia` hook into your component and pass a media query string to it:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useMatchMedia } from "abcdefuhooks";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isMobile = useMatchMedia("(max-width: 768px)");

  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? (
        <p>This is the mobile layout.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>This is the desktop layout.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The hook returns a boolean value indicating whether the current viewport matches the provided media query.

## Features

- **Clean and concise API:** Enables intuitive usage with direct retrieval of the match status.
- **Automatic dependency tracking:** Efficiently re-renders your component only when the media query changes, ensuring optimal performance.
- **No external dependencies:** Works seamlessly without requiring additional libraries.

## Example

Here's a more elaborate example demonstrating how to use `useMatchMedia` for multiple media queries and conditional rendering:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useMatchMedia } from "abcdefuhooks";

const ResponsiveLayout = () => {
  const isMobile = useMatchMedia("(max-width: 768px)");
  const isTablet = useMatchMedia("(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)");
  const isDesktop = useMatchMedia("(min-width: 1024px)");

  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile && <MobileLayout />}
      {isTablet && <TabletLayout />}
      {isDesktop && <DesktopLayout />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced scenarios, you can leverage advanced features of the `matchMedia` API:

- Access additional match details: Use the `matchMedia.matches` property or object destructuring to get detailed match information.
- Listen for specific properties: Utilize properties like `matchMedia.addChangeEventListener` to handle specific property changes.

## Compatibility

This hook is compatible with modern browsers that support the `window.matchMedia` API. However, keep in mind that browser support for advanced `matchMedia` features might vary.
